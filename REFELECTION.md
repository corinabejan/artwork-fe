What a journey!

This was actually I think the hardest 2 days of my life. It almost ended up in crying a lot of times. But i got at the point where I am writing this reflections, and I am happy and proud at the same time.

The back-end creation worked pretty fast, the front-end is another story. My Post requests weren't connecting with the back-end routes, and i got stuck on this for hours and hours and hours just to realize that in the post request for the starting an auction i was inversing two words so my back-end couldn't get the roght information, and in the bids post request i wasn't asking correctly for the token.

It was definetly difficult, but now i can really say that i finally understand redux(this is the biggets accomplishment of this days), and i can follow all the sequence of my files.

It was nice to do this, very difficult, but now i am confident that all the errors that i encountered in creating this app(and they were a lot), i will be able to fix them very quickly.

I am sorry for not doing any css(I know my page doesn't looks so nice), but i just didn't had any time left to do this.
